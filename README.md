# GUC scale GPA converter

If you’re a German University in Cairo student or Alumnus, then most likely you need to convert your gpa from the “unique” guc scale to the 4.0 scale whether it was for:



*   Applying for Jobs abroad
*   Make it easier for recruiters who aren’t familiar with our GPA system
*   Simply being curious about your 4.0 scale GPA!

After being in that situation myself, I decided to create a simple website for students and recruiters to use for converting your GPA in a matter of seconds.

All you have to do is go to **[https://guc-gpa.herokuapp.com/](https://guc-gpa.herokuapp.com/)**

and calculate your GPA now
